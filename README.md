## Welcome to the findit frontend project ðŸ‘‹

### If you stumbled across this repo make sure to read [the full documentation of our findit project](https://github.com/MaxSquared-WebCraft/findit) first!

There is not much to say other than this is a state of the art 2017 web project created
with the then available version of CRA. This project also uses redux for state management,
material-ui for ui components and axios for doing the web requests. Nothing out of the
ordinary for back then.

The juicy part of this project is the whole microservice backend, that's why we decided to
implement the frontend as quickly as possible.
